<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD student in Speech Science （School of Psychology） at the University of Auckland, supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UCIt79UAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> Dr. Patrick Savage</a> and <a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/sc-purdy" target="_blank"> Prof. Suzanne Purdy</a>.

My research focuses on investigating the relationship between speech and music from the perspectives of acoustics and social psychology. I am currently involved in the Many Voices 2 and Many Voices 3 projects.

Prior to my PhD, I received a BA in Chinese Language and Literature from Minzu University of China, and an MSc in Phonetics from the University of Edinburgh, where I was fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://edwebprofiles.ed.ac.uk/profile/alice-turk" target="_blank"> Prof. Alice Turk</a>. I later worked as a research assistant at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and Hong Kong Polytechnic University, contributing to projects in phonetics, psycholinguistics, and neurolinguistics.

[Higher Pitch, Slower Tempo, and Greater Stability in Singing than in Conversation among Mandarin speakers in Auckland: A Registered Report Replicating Ozaki et al.(2024)](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/gwavn_v1)

**Zixuan Jia**<sup>*</sup>, Suzanne Purdy, Patrick E. Savage<sup>*</sup>

[**Protocol**](https://github.com/comp-music-lab/manyvoices3) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We successfuly replicated Ozaki et al.'s findings that **"singing shows higher pitch, slower tempo, and greater stability than conversation"** among Mandarin speakers in Auckland, and generalized it to more participants without musical and academic backgrounds. 
- We also explored the potential musicianship effect on acoustic differences between speech and song.
