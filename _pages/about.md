<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year PhD student in Speech Science, affiliated with the School of Psychology at the University of Auckland. I am currently based in [Comp Music lab](https://sites.google.com/view/comp-music-lab/home), supervised by [Dr. Patrick Savage](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/patrick-savage) and [Prof. Suzanne Purdy](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/sc-purdy). 

Prior to my PhD, I received a BA in Chinese Language and Literature from [Minzu University of China](https://www.muc.edu.cn/), and an MSc in Phonetics from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Alice Turk](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/alice-turk). After that, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and Hong Kong Polytechnic University, gaining research experience in phonetics, social psychology, and neuroscience. These training experiences have led me to develop a strong interest in interdisciplinary research. I particularly enjoy integrating **acoustic, computational, social psychological, and neuroscientific approaches** to address questions at the intersection of **speech and music**, especially those concerning their form and function.

My PhD research incorporates three main projects:

- (a) [**Many Voices 2**](https://osf.io/pv3m9_v1): This project collects large-scale cross-cultural behavioural data to examine whether synchronized singing enhances social bonding more than conversation and recitation. It aims to address questions related to the evolution of music and to provide empirical evidence for the [***social bonding hypothesis***](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/music-as-a-coevolved-system-for-social-bonding/F1ACB3586FD3DD5965E56021F506BC4F).

- (b) [**Many Voices 3**](https://osf.io/c2dba): This project replicates and extends [***Ozaki et al.’s (2024)***](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adm9797) finding that ***singing uses higher pitch, slower tempo, and greater pitch stability than speech***. Using a substantially larger sample across 26 languages and sites, we will also conduct meta-analyses to evaluate the robustness and cross-cultural generality of these acoustic patterns. 

- (c)**Synchronization and Entrainment in dyadic singing and speaking**: This project moves beyond the traditional focus on individual recordings of singing and speech by examining these behaviours in dyadic contexts. Specifically, I investigate whether structural differences between song and speech relate to differences in synchronization during group singing, and whether the distinct social pressures associated with singing and speaking influence patterns of turn-taking entrainment. This project aims to further illuminate form–function relationships in speech and song from an interactional perspective.

[Higher Pitch, Slower Tempo, and Greater Stability in Singing than in Conversation among Mandarin speakers in Auckland: A Registered Report Replicating Ozaki et al.(2024)](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/gwavn_v1)

[**Protocol**](https://github.com/comp-music-lab/manyvoices3) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We successfuly replicated Ozaki et al.'s findings that **"singing shows higher pitch, slower tempo, and greater stability than conversation"** among Mandarin speakers in Auckland, and generalized it to more participants without musical and academic backgrounds. 
- We also explored the potential musicianship effect on acoustic differences between speech and song.
